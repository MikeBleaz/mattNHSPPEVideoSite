    <b>Question 1</b><br><br>
    Does the environment you work in have a safe corridor?
    <br><br>
    A safe corridor connects all patient rooms and can be closed to patients i.e. they do not need to use the corridor to get to a toilet or shower. This is true where all rooms or bays have en-suite facilities and are separated by door to the "safe corridor". If you are still unsure see the separate section entitled "How do I find out which clinical environment I am working in?"<br><br>

    <button id="yesSafeCorridorButton" class="float-left submit-button" >Yes, we have a safe corridor</button>
    <button id="noSafeCorridorButton" class="float-left submit-button" >No, we don't have a safe corridor </button>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.getElementById("yesSafeCorridorButton").onclick = function () {
            location.href = "areThereBays.html";
        };
        document.getElementById("noSafeCorridorButton").onclick = function () {
